# Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various Project Euler problems. Project Euler is a
collection of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that often require creative
problem-solving techniques.

My python solutions are managed with a tool I wrote called [euler](https://github.com/i13e/euler)
to fetch problem descriptions, generate files, and test if a solution is valid. Check out the repo
for more info.

## About Project Euler

Project Euler is a fantastic platform that provides a wide range of mathematical and computational
problems designed to challenge your problem-solving skills.
These problems cover a diverse array of topics, from number theory to combinatorics, and require
creative and efficient algorithms to solve.

If you're new to Project Euler, I highly recommend checking out their [official
website](https://projecteuler.net/) and trying out some problems yourself.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, simply clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/i13e/project-euler.git
```

You can then navigate to the specific problem you're interested in and find the solution code along
with any relevant explanations.

## Usage

Each problem's solution is organized within its own directory, typically containing one or more
source code files. You can explore the solutions to specific problems by browsing the repository or
using the search feature.

Feel free to use these solutions as a reference or starting point for your own Project Euler
journey. However, I encourage you to attempt the problems on your own first before consulting these
solutions.
